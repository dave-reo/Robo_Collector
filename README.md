# Robo_Collector

## Introduction
The Robo_Collector was inspired by the classic "Hungry Hippos" game where players complete to collect as many marbles as possible. However, our goal was to take this concept to the next level by creating a sophisticated robot capable of finding, picking up, and sorting ping pong balls. We aimed to develop the mechanical, electrical, and software systems for this robot by using concepts learned in the mechatronics concentration at Cal Poly.
